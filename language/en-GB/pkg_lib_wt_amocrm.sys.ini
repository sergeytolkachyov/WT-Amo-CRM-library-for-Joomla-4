PKG_LIB_WT_AMOCRM_WHATS_NEW="<h3>v.1.2.0 What's new?</h3><h4>Joomla 5 ready</h4><p>The library has been successfully tested with Joomla 5.</p><h4>Deleting the old refresh token</h4><p>Amo CRM issues an access token for one day. To get a new token, a refresh token is used. Refresh token is valid for only 3 months. If the integration has not been used for 3 months, there has not been a single request to update the key, then the integration will lose access to the data and we will need to re-create and configure the integration.</p><p>To simplify this process, a button to delete the old refresh token from the database has been added to the plugin parameters. If the refresh token is in the database, the date of its receipt is displayed. You should use this button only if your refresh token has expired and you need to remove it from the library settings.</p><h4>Language constants</h4><p>The plugin parameters have been modified to use Joomla language constants. Added English localization.</p>"
